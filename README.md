# World_Weather_Analysis
Plot the relationship between latitude and weather for cities around the world using **Python, Pandas, and APIs**.

## Steps
Python, decision and repetition statements, data structures, Pandas, Matplotlib, and SciPy statistics

• Retrieve and use data from an **API** `get` request to a server. <br>
• Retrieve and store values from a **JSON** array.<br>
• Use `try` and `except` blocks to resolve errors.<br>
• Write **Python** *functions*.<br>
• Create *scatter plots* using the **Matplotlib** library, and apply styles and features to a plot.<br>
• Perform **linear regression**, and add regression lines to scatter plots.<br>
• Create *heatmaps*, and add *markers* using the **Google Maps API**.<br>

## Discussion
Add data to the cities DataFrame, so that customers know the weather in the cities when they click on a *pop-up marker*, and<br> the amount of rainfall or snowfall within last three hours so customers can filter the DataFrame using *input statements* based on the temperature range and whether or not it is raining or snowing. <br>Finally, a *directions layer* Google map was created to show the directions between multiple cities for travel.
